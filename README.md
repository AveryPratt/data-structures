# data-structures

This repository contains sample code for several classic data structures in Python.

Linked List:
A singly-linked list containing nodes that all stem from the head.
methods:
- push(self, val)
    adds a node containing val to the head of the list.
- pop(self)
    removes the node at the head of the list and returns the value.
- size(self)
    returns the number of nodes on the stack.
- search(self, val)
    returns the closest node to the head of the list that contains val.
- remove(self, node)
    removes node from the list.
- display(self)
    returns a string displaying the contents of the list in the format of a tuple.

Stack (composed from linked list):
A data structure with basic first-in: first-out functionality
methods:
- push(self, val)
    adds a node containing val to the top of the stack
- pop(self)
    removes and returns the value at the top of the stack
